# AzureExtensions
PowerShell extensions for Azure and Office 365.

* Ax.Cosmos – Alpha version of a some CosmosDB cmdlets.  See the next steps for the work still to do.
* Ax.Markdown – Quick and dirty script that extracts the help info from an Azure module and generates a Markdown page for it. Useful for those 3rd party modules which often don’t have very much documentation, except within each cmdlet itself.
