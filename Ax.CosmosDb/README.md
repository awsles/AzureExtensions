# Az.CosmosDb
This small module provides the following commands


# Next Steps

* Eliminate need for .Key property in AxCosmosContext.
This involves changing the code to use the hmacSHA256 instance. 

* Improve the Query-AxCosmosDocuments cmdlet.
The cmdlet is fairly narrow and tedious to use.
Provide a "simple" mode along side the more complex query mode.
